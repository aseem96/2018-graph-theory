\begin{question}{1}
Prove that every simple planar graph has a vertex of degree at most 5.
\end{question}

\begin{question}{4}
Prove that $\chi(\bar{H}) = \omega(\bar{H})$ when $H$ is bipartite and has no isolated vertices. (Hint: Phrase the conclusion in terms of H and apply results about bipartite graphs.)\\

Let $X$ and $Y$ be bipartitions of $H$ and let $|X| \geq |Y| $

By Proposition 5.1.7: For every graph $H$, $\chi(H)\geq\omega(H)$. To prove that $\chi(H)= \omega(H)$ we need to demonstrate a method to color $\bar{H}$ using only $\omega(\bar{H})$ colors.\\

Since cliques in $\bar{H}$ are independent sets in $H$, this is the same as coloring $\bar{H}$ with $\omega(\bar{H}) =  \alpha(H)$ colors.\\ 

We know that $\alpha(H) = \beta'(H)$ for a bipartite with no isolated vertices\\

We also know that $\alpha'(H) + \beta'(H) = n(H)$, which can be combined with the previous formula to give $\alpha(H) = n(H)-\alpha'(H)$. \\

Let M be a maximum matching of $\bar{H}$, for every edge $uv$ in M with $u \epsilon X$ and $v \epsilon Y$, assign every $uv$ pair the same color (so ${uv}_1$ gets color 1, ${uv}_x$ gets color x). For every other vertex in $X$ and $Y$ assign a unique color. There are $n-2|M|$ vertices not in M, the number of colors used is $|M| + (n-2|M|) = n - \alpha'(H) = \omega(\bar{H})$ . Thus proving that the inverse of any bipartite graph with no isolated vertices (H) can be colored with $\omega(\bar{H})$ colors.

\end{question}

\begin{question}{5}
(!) Prove that Brooks' Theorem is equivalent to the following statement: every $k-1$-regular $k$-critical graph is a complete graph or an odd cycle.\\

Brooks' Theorem:
If $G$ is a (simple) connected graph other than a clique or an odd cycle, then $\chi(G) = \Delta(G)$. \\

Let the statement - every $k-1$-regular $k$-critical graph is a complete graph or an odd cycle be S. Let us assume that Brooks' theorem is true.
Let G be a $k-1$ regular $k$ critical graph. Thus we have, $\Delta (G) = k-1$ and $\chi (G) = K$. According to Brook's theorem, $G$ must be a complete graph or an odd cycle, which is equivalent to $S$. Hence, $S$ follows. \\ \\
Now we need to show that the vice versa is also true. \\ \\
Conversely assume $S$ is true. Let $G$ be a connected graph with chromatic number $k$. To prove the Brooks' theorem, we must show that $\Delta(G) \geq k$ unless $G$ is a complete graph or odd cycle. For that, assume $H$ is the $k$-critical subgraph of $G$. It follows that $\delta (H) \geq k-1$. If $\Delta(G) < k$, then $k- 1 \leq \delta(H) \leq \Delta(H) \leq \Delta(G) < k$. This means that H must be $k-1$ regular. By $S$, $H$ is therefore a complete graph or an odd cycle. If $\Delta(G)  = k-1$, then no vertex of $H$ has an additional incident edge in $G$. Thus, $H$ is a component of $G$, so it is all of $G$ as $G$ is connected. If $\Delta (G) < \chi (G)$, then $G$ is a complete graph or odd cycle. This shows that $S$ implies Brooks' theorem.
